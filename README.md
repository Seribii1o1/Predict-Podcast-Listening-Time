# Predict Podcast Listening Time
 Predict listening time of podcast episodes

**1.Initial Research**

i. Literature Review and Kaggle Notebooks:

[Use sklearnâ€™s neural network to predict on podcast listening times](https://tracyrenee61.medium.com/use-sklearns-neural-network-to-predict-on-podcast-listening-times-410e3ec856a6)

The author opted for a non-linear model called MLPRegressor(a type of neural network) from the scikit-learn library.

[Podcast Trends: Predicting Listening Time|PS5E4](https://www.kaggle.com/code/marianadeem755/podcast-trends-predicting-listening-time-ps5e4)

This participant completed data exploration, categorical encoding, feature engineering, and used an Ensemble approach, combining predictions from both LGBM and CatBoost models.

[Kaggle-Predict-Podcast-Listening-Time](https://github.com/jhould007/Kaggle-Predict-Podcast-Listening-Time/tree/main)

This participant used the H2O AutoML library to build their model.

[1st Place - RAPIDS cuML Stack - 3 Levels!](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s5e4/discussion/575784)

This participant won the competition with a RAPIDS cuML stack of 3 levels.

ii. Data selection:

Train.csv for EDA, transform, and model
Test.csv for model prediction
sample_submission.csv as an example for Kaggle submission

iii. Challenges:

Time is an initial challenge since both the Kaggle and class deadlines were tight.


**2.[EDA](/Users/sa26/Documents/GitHub/Predict-Podcast-Listening-Time/code/EDA.ipynb)**

Notebook where I performed univariate, bivariate, and multivariate exploratory analysis on dataset.
I created relevant graphs to help formulate a hypothesis. 

**3.[Data Transformation Pipeline](/Users/sa26/Documents/GitHub/Predict-Podcast-Listening-Time/code/transform.ipynb)**

Some of the columns had a strong correlation and linearity, so I dropped them.
I saved this dataframe as a new csv file to be used in the next step.

**4.[Model Generation, Selection, and Hyperparameter Tuning](/Users/sa26/Documents/GitHub/Predict-Podcast-Listening-Time/code/model.ipynb)**
Once exploring the dataset, I created a notebook to generate multiple models. Upon re-training the models using hyperparameter tuning, then outputing the respective accuracy scores for each model; I selected the one that has the best performance.
